Hi, I'm Amren.
<br>
I'm a student studying a Bachelor of Science in Games Development at the University of Technology Sydney.
<br>
I'm interested in programming, computer hardware and computer software. I have undertaken quite a few small programming projects and have built, maintained and upgraded PCs.
